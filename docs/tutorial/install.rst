Installation
============

Unitair can be installed with pip::

    pip install unitair


.. note::
    Unitair should be installed in an isolated environment.
    PyTorch (``torch``) is a dependency,
    and is installed automatically if it is not already installed.
    If you need to compile ``torch`` with CUDA, then you should
    set up PyTorch before installing Unitair.
